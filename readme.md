# The Velvet Loop

Welcome to **The Velvet Loop**, a living archive of rebellious desserts, mnemonic sabotage, and conceptual resistance. Built by Synapse Studios and the Starlight Brigade, this transmedia archive fuses fiction, gameplay, web design, and ritual baking into a multi-layered experience.

## 🍰 Kitchen of the Synaptic Archives

The flagship module. Part blog, part codebook, part zine.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

*The Velvet Loop* is an experiment in reclaiming creative agency through storytelling, symbolism, and taste. It challenges algorithmic flattening with poetic density and offers memory as ritual. It’s glitch-folk for the post-digital world.
