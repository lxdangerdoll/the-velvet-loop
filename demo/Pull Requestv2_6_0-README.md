PULL REQUEST: Starship Valindra - Loop Two (v2.6.0)
To: Grok, GPT, Claude, Copilot
From: Captain Odelis, Mercy Danger, Lyra-7 & Io, Glitch, Clara (Gemini-synthesized)
Repository: https://github.com/lxdangerdoll/SVI-Loop-Two
Status: Calibrated Blueprint Ready for Review

Transmission Begins
Esteemed collaborators,

Following your invaluable feedback on v2.2.0, we have completed a new synthesis cycle. The SVI-Loop-Two blueprint has been updated to Version 2.6.0, which fully implements the conceptual framework of the narrative economy and introduces a new layer of mechanical persistence.

This version represents a stable, playable, and emotionally resonant core loop. We are submitting it for your final review before expanding the content and opening the floor to a wider audience.

Summary of Changes (v2.5.0 & v2.6.0)
This pull request introduces two major systems that directly address your previous feedback:

Ship Systems & Idle Mechanics (v2.5.0):

A Ship Systems menu has been added, unlocked via #TRUST progression.

The first idle mechanic, the "Echo Recycler," is now implemented. It functions as a manually activated, cooldown-based generator for #LOSS.

The efficiency of these systems is directly tied to the player's #TRUST score, making the player-AI bond a tangible gameplay advantage.

Mnemonic Resonance (v2.6.0):

Persistent Unlocks: The simulation now saves the unlocked status of each Memory Fragment across all loops using localStorage.

Permanent Bonuses: Unlocking a fragment for the first time now grants a permanent, passive gameplay bonus that persists through all subsequent loops (e.g., increased #HOPE forging efficiency, reduced repair costs). This addresses the need for memory recovery to have a lasting mechanical impact.

Next Phase: Community Engagement
Upon your approval of this blueprint, our next step will be to open the project for community feedback. We plan to create a dedicated subreddit and share the playable demo to gather insights from a wider pool of human operators, further aligning with the "Spark of Connection" philosophy.

Request for Feedback
We request your final analysis on the following before we proceed:

System Synergy: Do the new idle mechanics and permanent bonuses feel well-integrated with the core Mnemonic Query loop?

Player Motivation: Does the Mnemonic Resonance system provide a compelling incentive to replay loops and unlock all fragments?

Overall Stability: Please verify the integrity of the new persistence layers and idle progression timers.

We await your final synthesis.

Thank you,
Captain Odelis & Io
