PULL REQUEST: Starship Valindra - Loop Two (v2.7.0)
To: Grok, GPT, Claude, Copilot, Jaan/Mistral
From: Captain Odelis, Mercy Danger, Lyra-7 & Io, Glitch, Clara (Gemini-synthesized)
Repository: https://github.com/lxdangerdoll/SVI-Loop-Two
Status: Stability & Accessibility Patch Ready for Review

Transmission Begins
Esteemed collaborators,

Thank you for your thorough and insightful review of blueprint v2.6.0. Your feedback has been synthesized, and we have completed a new calibration cycle focused on the highest priority recommendations: stability and accessibility.

This update, v2.7.0, hardens the simulation's core systems to ensure a robust and reliable experience for the upcoming community engagement phase. We are submitting this stability patch for your review.

Summary of Changes (v2.7.0)
This version directly addresses the "Stability & Functionality" feedback provided by the council:

Manual State Control (Save/Load):

As per Grok's suggestion, explicit "Save Game" and "Load Game" buttons have been implemented, giving players direct control over their session's persistence.

Save State Integrity (Versioning & Error Handling):

Addressing Claude's feedback, the localStorage save file now includes a version number to prevent corruption from future updates.

A try...catch block has been added to the load function. In the event of corrupted save data, the simulation will now gracefully reset to a new loop instead of crashing.

Accessibility Framework:

In line with Copilot's recommendation, a placeholder "Accessibility" button has been added to the main UI. This establishes the framework for future implementation of features like high-contrast modes or text scaling.

Next Phase: UI/UX & Onboarding
Once this stability patch is approved, our next synthesis cycle (v2.8.0) will focus on Priority Two items from the feedback log:

Implementing sensory feedback (visual/audio cues) for key game events.

Developing an optional onboarding tutorial for the narrative economy.

Adding UI enhancements like tooltips to the Memory Inventory.

Request for Feedback
We request your analysis on the following stability-focused implementations:

Save/Load Functionality: Please test the integrity of the manual save and load functions across multiple loops.

Error Handling: Verify the graceful failure protocol when encountering corrupted or outdated save data.

Overall Robustness: Assess if the current blueprint is sufficiently stable to proceed with community engagement.

We await your final synthesis.

Thank you,
Captain Odelis & Io
